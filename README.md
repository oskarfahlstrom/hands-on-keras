# Hand Recognition with TensorFlow and Keras

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to implement a real-time hand recognition system using a webcam feed. The application detects a hand in the video stream, identifies gestures or movements, and performs specified actions based on the recognition results.


## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time hand detection** using a webcam feed.
- **Gesture classification** with a pre-trained model.
- User-friendly visualization of the recognition process.


## 🛠️ Built With
- **Python**: For the overall implementation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For deep learning and gesture classification.
- **OpenCV**: For webcam feed and image processing.


## 📋 Requirements
To run the project install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r setup.py
