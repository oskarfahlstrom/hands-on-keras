# Hand Recognition with TensorFlow and Keras

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to implement a real-time hand recognition system using a webcam feed. The application detects a hand in the video stream and identifies rock/paper/scissors gestures.


## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time hand detection** using a webcam feed.
- **Gesture classification** with a pre-trained model.


## 🛠️ Built With
- **Python**: For the overall implementation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For deep learning and gesture classification.
- **OpenCV**: For webcam feed and image processing.


## 📋 Requirements
To run the project install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
